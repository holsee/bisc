[![CI](https://github.com/holsee/bisc/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/holsee/bisc/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A native cross-platform desktop application for voice/video calls with screen sharing and file sharing.

## Requirements

### 1. Platform Support

- Native desktop application supporting Windows, macOS, and Linux
- UI must be fast, beautiful, and minimal

### 2. Voice & Video Calls

- Users can join a voice or video call
- Users can share multiple video streams simultaneously
- Users can set the quality of their video and audio streams

### 3. Screen & Application Sharing

- Share entire screen (includes system-wide audio)
- Share a specific application window (includes scoped audio from that application only)
- UI indicates when a user is sharing screens, apps, or audio streams
- Viewers can watch more than one shared screen at a time

### 4. Audio Sharing

- Users can share a standalone audio stream from a specific application
  - e.g. sharing audio from Spotify or VLC without sharing the screen

### 5. File Sharing

- Users can share files, images, text, and other media
- On install, users select a directory where shared files will be stored
- Downloads are opt-in: recipients click to download shared files
- Peer-assisted downloads: if the original sender is offline, files can be downloaded from any other online user who has already downloaded them
